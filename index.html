      <h2> Welcome to my page and here's a brief intro about myself:  </h2>
      <p> I was born 8,400 miles away from Kansas in <strong >Gujarat, India. </strong> When I was 9 years old, my parents decided to apply for a U.S. Visa and then we boarded on an 18 hour flight to Chicago. I have lived in many differnt states from the west side of America to now the midwest. Currently I live with my parents in Pittsburg but plan to move once I land a job in Kansas City. I have a younger sister named Rutu who's in middle school. During winter break I went to Colorado and took that amazing photo of myself.
